## Projects in course

#### Data Structures

##### Reconstruct photo in random view point through several photos

How to get a photo in random view point though several photos of this scene? There are several traditional way can reconstruct 3D model from RGB photos. However, simply projecting the 3D model will get some black area for there are always some objects lacking enough information can not be reconstruct. In paper *Depth Synthesis and Local Warps for Plausible Image-based Navigation*, a new method using the wrap of photos taken near the assigned view point was purposed. 

1. use MVE to get point cloud and the paraments of camera of different photos.
2. reconstruction of photos
   1. divide the photos into superpixels
   2. get depth information of each superpixels through 3D point cloud
   3. for those superpixels without corresponding point cloud, use the nearest superpixels’ depth. ‘Near’ is defined by the similarity graph. Dijkstra Algorithm can be applied here.
3. Interpolation
   1. distort 4 nearest photos to current view point
   2. average of 4 photos’ result

##### 3D reconstruction through multiple views

Reconstruction of visual hull is a time costing work. Here I use the conception of Octree to reduce the computational complexity of reconstruction and inquiry about neighboring information.

With appropriate data structure, the computation time of point cloud is reduced 10 times(from 17s to 1.7s). 

Also, PCA is applied to calculate the normal vector.

##### Transformation of face

Transform a face into a expression from another one.

1. extract the key points of human face(68 points).
2. use TPS or B-spline to get the transformation function of two groups of key points.
3. apply the transformation to distort the source image. Interpolation is applied to calculate the value of integer points from value of non-integer points(from distortion). Different interpolate methods are used and its errors are analyzed.

####   Modern Human Factors - Project IHOS

IHOS is a project about an app to provide better experience in hospital.

![IHOS](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/thumbnail/a54c26b100784447b8f3/1024/Project%20IHOS/IHOS.jpg)
> After discussion in group, we find that there are problems within the existing medical procedure so we decide to choose it as our topic. Our project aims at solving the problems during a medical procedure that are inconvenient for patients and some also make patients uncomfortable, for instance, the repeat payments and the test rooms hard to find. Our target users, the patients want to spend less time, have a convenient and comfortable medical procedure. However, the information they need is provided by the system so they have no access to optimize it. It may be a solution that they remember all the rooms’ positions, but it is definitely another burden for them.

Under this goal, we did some user study, comparative analysis, then we decided our target users, requirements of our product. Next, we had brain storm to set up our conceptual design and display it with low-fidelity prototype. After heuristic evaluation by ourselves and other groups, we refined our design and created our high-fidelity prototype with `Justinmind`. Finally we did user testing and concluded this project.

[the final report of IHOS](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/cdf04557d8c84e649d5b/)

Our project is the most popular project in final presentation. We got chocolate as the reward from Ms. Gao.
